# NOTE: Relying on the controlrepo gem in jenkins will end up with over 100 gems
# installed as dependencies.  When running in CI, this can be unnecessarily time
# consuming, especially if only RSpec tests are being exercised.  Consuder using
# the controlrepo gem when integration and system level tests are exericsed, but
# for now I recommend only using it in development, not when testing in CI.

group :development do
  # controlrepo is a helper tool to setup spec and integration testing inside of a
  # Puppet control repository.  We're not using the rake rakes, but instead
  # directly invoking `rspec spec` in an effort to cut down on the amount of
  # implicit, magic behavior.  The controlrepo gem provides value in the form of
  # an updated set of depenencies suitable for spec testing using rspec-puppet.
